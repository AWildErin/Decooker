# Decooker
A public mirror of my package deserializer. Currently doesn't handle exporting levels or objects, and I have no ETA when that code will be published  
But at a bare minimum it does load packages, and you can view the properties. Eventually, the tool will be complete but that'll be after my personal project with it is completed.
